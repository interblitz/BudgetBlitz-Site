Download and update without Google Play
=======================================

Actions for update
------------------

#. Allow applications from unknown sources to be installed on your device.
#. Download and install the |bstore_link|_ app. Google Play security will alert you to an unknown app. This is ok.
#. Run |bstore_link| and go to settings.
#. In the settings, specify your Google Play account and order number. If you have a promo code, enter the promo code instead of the order. After entering the order number, press OK and be sure to wait until the order number appears on the screen. If the order number is not displayed, it is not valid. You cannot receive an upgrade with that order number.
#. Go back to the main screen and update |app_name| to the current stable or beta version.

Notes
-----

The update is only available to Google Play users who bought |app_name| or installed it with a promo code. For users who installed |app_name| during the free sale, the update is not available.

For users who bought the application in Yandex Store update is not available.

At the moment the purchase of the application is not available, only an update is possible.
